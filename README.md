# Reflection
Creating a portfolio on GitHub was both a rewarding and challenging experience. One of the biggest challenges I faced was learning how to effectively use Git and GitHub, especially when it came to version control and understanding the difference between local and remote repositories. Initially, I struggled with pushing updates and resolving merge conflicts, but after consulting GitHub documentation and watching tutorial videos, I became more confident with the workflow.

Another challenge was designing a visually appealing and functional website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I had to troubleshoot several layout and styling issues, particularly making the portfolio responsive across different devices. I used online tools like W3Schools and Stack Overflow to find solutions and best practices, which greatly helped me debug and improve the site.

Hosting the portfolio via GitHub Pages was also a new experience. At first, I had issues with the site not displaying properly due to incorrect file paths and case sensitivity in filenames. By carefully checking my file structure and being consistent with naming conventions, I was able to resolve these issues.

In the next version of the portfolio, I would focus on improving the overall design by incorporating modern UI frameworks like Bootstrap or Tailwind CSS. I would also add more interactive elements, such as animations or a contact form, and ensure better accessibility for all users. Additionally, I plan to regularly update the portfolio to reflect new projects and skills, and perhaps integrate it with a custom domain for a more professional appearance.
